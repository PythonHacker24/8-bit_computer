# An 8-Bit TTL Microprocessor with Custom Architecture

A TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) computer is a type of computer system that uses transistors as there base components by manipulating them into gates which are then used
develop logics. TTL is a family of digital logic ICs that were widely used in the early days of computing and electronics, mainly during the 1960s and 1970s. 

This is a circuit prototye for the development of a custion architecture 8-bit Microprocessor. This is still in the development stage and is expected to be a fully functional and usable Microprocessor. The goal is to make the processor programmable with custom instructions.
